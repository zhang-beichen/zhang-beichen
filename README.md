- 👋 Hi, I’m Beichen Zhang @bzhang9683
- 👀 I’m interested in applying geospatial techniques (RS, GIS, etc.) and data science (ML, DL, etc.) to study the impacts of climate extremes, such as the impacts of increasing natural disasters.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning applied climatology, ML, DL, causal inference, and statistical modeling.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interdisciplinary research of AI, climate extremes, climate change, and remote sensing.
- 📫 How to reach me: beichen@huksers.unl.edu
