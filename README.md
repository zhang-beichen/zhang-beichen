- 👋 Hi, I’m Beichen Zhang @zhang-beichen
- 👀 I’m interested in applying geospatial techniques (RS, GIS, etc.) and data science (ML, DL, etc.) to study the impacts of climate extremes and decarbonization on the natural environment and human society.
- 🌱 I’m actively learning climatology, hydrology, agent-based modeling for complex systems, advanced DL models, and causal inference & causal ML.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interdisciplinary research of AI, decarbonization, climate extremes, remote sensing, and decision intelligence.
- 📫 How to reach me: beichen.research at gmail dot com
